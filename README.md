As a student taking this course, I gained valuable hands-on experience with microcontrollers and coding through the Introduction to Microcontrollers & Coding program. Using the Centrado development kit, I learned about the internal architecture of microcontrollers and how to integrate them into electronic circuits.

The course started with the basics - how to setup the coding environment, interface with the microcontroller pins using C/C++ programs, control LEDs and read data from sensors. I particularly enjoyed the labs where we got to build real circuits using the microcontroller and test out the code we wrote. Debugging the programs and figuring out the pin connections strengthened my understanding of the concepts.

By the end of the course, I was able to write C code utilizing the full potential of the microcontroller - setting up timers and interrupts, PWM control, communication protocols and more. The knowledge gained has equipped me with core embedded programming skills that I can readily apply for projects and further learning. I appreciate the hands-on nature of the course that allowed me to translate theory into practical microcontroller applications. Overall, it was an engaging introduction to the world of microcontrollers and embedded systems development.
